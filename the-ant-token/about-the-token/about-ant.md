## What is ANT?

Aragon Network Token (ticker: [**ANT**](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/aragon/)) is the native token of Aragon. ANT is primarily used for the **governance** of the Aragon Network. ANT holders can participate in Aragon Governance by voting on proposals. Historically the ANT token was used for staking in Aragon Court. This use today is dismissed.

## ANT Uses

### Governance

The first use of ANT is as a Sybil-resistant mechanism for governance. It is the main coordination mechanism of the Aragon community.

Current community polls backed by ANT can be found on the [Aragon Voice ](https://voice.aragon.org/tokens/info/#/0xa117000000f279d81a1d3cc75430faa017fa5a2e)App. Since the launch of the Aragon Network DAO ([AN DAO](https://andao.aragon.org/)), the token has been used on Aragon Voice to vote on proposals for the project. Each token holder can vote on proposals and participate in the community's decisions. Tokens represent voting power - a user with 500 tokens has 500 times more voting power than a user with 1 token.

In the past, ANT was used in the [Aragon Governance Proposal (AGP) process](https://github.com/aragon/AGPs/blob/master/AGPs/AGP-1.md#aragon-network-votes), [first approved by ANT holders](https://blog.aragon.org/final-results-from-the-agp-1-vote/) on November 17, 2018. In this construct, one ANT was equal to one vote, allowing anyone to vote on AGPs--even while remaining pseudonymous, by acquiring and holding ANT at the time of a vote. In preparation for the Aragon Network's launch, ANT holders voted to [sunset the AGP process](https://blog.aragon.org/final-results-from-aragon-network-vote-6) on March 13, 2020.

### Further issuance

ANT's total supply was fixed at 43,165,291**.**21 ANT. This total supply was constant only until the Aragon Network was deployed. Since then the ANT's issuance policy and inflation rate going forward has been be decided by the ANT holders participating in governance of the Aragon Network.
