* ANTv1 is a ERC20 token, specifically a [MiniMe token](antv1-about-the-minime-token.md)
* Its current controller is a non-changeable controller, [`0x2443d44325bb07861Cd8C9C8Ba1569b6c39D9d95`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2443d44325bb07861Cd8C9C8Ba1569b6c39D9d95), only allowing a specified address to mint more tokens
* [ANTv1 has been deprecated in favour of ANTv2](../upgrading-to-antv2/), but ANTv1 will forever be a functional ERC-20 token that is transferable and tradable

## The ANTv1

The original Aragon Network Token ("**ANTv1**" and sometimes "**ANT (old)**") is an ERC20-compliant token deployed to **Ethereum mainnet**. It was launched through the [Aragon Network Token sale](https://blog.aragon.org/announcing-the-aragon-network-token-sale-fe83fe36902c) in May, 2017.

Although previously configurable, the token will now (and forever) closely mimic a vanilla ERC20 token:

* Its supply, and holders' balances, are constant
* All transfers are allowed, with no internal fee mechanisms
* No functionality for blacklisting addresses

In addition to the vanilla behaviour, it implemented a number of features that were intended to be used when governing the Aragon Network:

* Historical token balance records
* Cloning, with balances from a specific block snapshot
* An optional controller (see below)

And finally, a specific behaviour was added for the initial launch period:

* Irrevocable time-based vesting from a whitelisted granter, used during the token sale and afterwards to generate the [presale allocations](https://blog.aragon.org/pre-sale-transparency-report-333e310304c).

## Controller

The controller of a MiniMe token holds significant power over the token itself (more information available in the [MiniMe section](antv1-about-the-minime-token.md)).

The current controller of ANT is a **final, non-changeable contract**, [`ANTController`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2443d44325bb07861Cd8C9C8Ba1569b6c39D9d95#code). This contract limits the token controller related function of ANT to only allowing a specified address to call `generateTokens()`.

Currently this address is the Community Multisig [0xbEEFbEeF03c7E5a1C29E0Aa675f8E16AEe0A5FAd](https://etherscan.io/address/0xbeefbeef03c7e5a1c29e0aa675f8e16aee0a5fad).

## ANTv2 upgrade

In light of technical advancements in the Ethereum and decentralized technology ecosystems, [ANTv1 has been deprecated in favour of ANTv2](../upgrading-to-antv2/) as the Aragon Network's governance token.

> Despite being deprecated, ANTv1 is forever "unstoppable": it will continue to be transferable and tradable on Ethereum.
