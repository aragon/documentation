# App Center

The _**App Center**_ has tabs for upgrading currently-installed apps and browsing apps which are currently available (not that some apps are _not maintained_ anymore to be recognized by a _not maintained_ label).

To upgrade an existing app, simply click the _**Upgrade app**_ button and open a vote to upgrade the app if you do not have direct permission to upgrade the app.
