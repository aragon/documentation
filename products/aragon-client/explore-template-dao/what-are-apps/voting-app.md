# Voting App

The Voting app makes it easy for you to poll your fellow token holders about their position on an infinite range of topics. Votes initiated by other Aragon apps also show up in the Voting app.

{% hint style="info" %}
For example, assigning tokens using the Token Manager or moving funds from the Finance app are each action that require a vote by token holders in a Company organization.
{% endhint %}

The _**Voting app**_ is where you can see all open and closed votes. You can also use the Voting app to start a new vote and poll token holders in the organization about an issue that is important to you.

## **Open votes**

The _**Open votes**_ section shows how many open votes there are and cards for each of the open votes, which show how much time is left in the vote, the number of the vote, a snippet of the issue being voted on, and the current status of the vote.

You can click on the card to expand it and, if you have permission, either cast you vote if you have not voted yet or change your vote if you have already voted.

### Vote card

The vote card tell you more detailed information about the status of a vote, such as:

* **The vote number**
* **The question being voted on**
* **What entity created the vote**
* **Current votes:** showing how many tokens in total have so far voted yes and how many have voted no
* **Time remaining:** how much time is left until the vote closes, should no other votes cast cause the vote to automatically pass.
* **Relative Support %**: what percent of voters are required to vote “yes” for the vote to pass, what percent of voters and how many tokens have voted “yes”, and what percent of voters and how many tokens have voted “no”.
* **Minimum Approval %**: what percent of the total token supply is needed to vote “yes” for the vote to be valid, and what percent of the total token supply has voted “yes” so far.
* **If you have not yet cast your vote**, buttons for voting “yes” or “no”.
* **If you have already voted**, a button for changing your vote.
* **How much voting power** your vote will have based on your token balance at the beginning of the vote, along with the block number that the vote snapshot was taken from.

## **Closed votes**

The _**Closed votes**_ section shows how many past votes there have been as well as cards for each of the past votes. Each card shows the date of the past vote, the number of the vote, a snippet of the issue being voted on, and the outcome of the vote.

Clicking on the vote will then show you more detailed information about the vote. See the previous section "Vote card" for a detailed explanation of the information in the _**View vote**_ panel.

## **New vote**

If there is an important question you have that you want to poll token holders in the organization about, you can click the _**New vote**_ button to start a new vote. These votes are purely informative and will not directly result in any further action being taken in the organization.

After you have filled out the text field (_Question_ filed) in the _**New vote**_ panel with the question you want to ask, you can click _**Create new** vote_ to complete the action and create a new vote if you have permission.

### **Vote on the proposal, then ask the other token holders to review and vote on the proposal**

Vote on the proposal you just created. Then rally your fellow token holders outside the app - for example, by email, forum, chat room, or face-to-face - and ask them to review and vote on the proposal too.

Token holders can also visit the Voting app to see the list of open votes and cast their ballot accordingly.

### **Other token holders cast their vote**

In this case, the other token holder in the organization supports the proposal and votes "Yes".

### **Review the vote**

Since there are only two token holders in this organization, and the Support parameter is set to 50%, the unanimous vote on the proposal has resulted in the proposal being passed.
