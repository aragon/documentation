# Navigating your Vocdoni organization

{% hint style="info" %}
In this section, you will learn how to navigate through an Organization created using Aragon Vocdoni.
{% endhint %}

## Steps to navigate in your Vocdoni organization

On the top right click on the name of your entity/organization (in our case _**Vodconi Test**_). A drop-down menu appears with the following categories:

* Dashboard
* Public Page
* Update entity
* Create account backup
* Help & Feedback
* Language
* Logout

All these sections will be described below.

### Dashboard

On the dashboard page, you can create a new vote using the **Creating a voting process** button.

{% hint style="danger" %}
If you haven't made a backup of your account you will see an alert message shown in an orange box (see the example above).

**=> In this case, please, proceed with the backup of your account as described in the** **dedicated** [**paragraph** **below**](./#createaccountbackup)**.**
{% endhint %}

### Voting box

The list of votes is in the dedicated box.

The Votes are grouped by:

* **Active votes:** open vote proposals
* **Ended Votes:** closed vote proposals
* **Upcoming Votes:** vote proposals that aren't already opened

Clicking on a Vote (in our example _**Test Vote**_) you can see the vote details. For example how many have voted and the status.

### Public page

The public page shows the information about your entity/organization. It can be accessed by everyone (only in read mode).

The page shows:

* the name of the entity/organization,
* the logo, the header,
* the entity description,
* the entity address,
* the entity processes.

### Create account backup <a href="#createaccountbackup" id="createaccountbackup"></a>

On the _**Download credentials**_ page you can protect your entity's account by exporting it and storing it in a safe place.

* Select in the drop-down menu your favourite 3 Recovery questions and fill in your replies.
* Confirm your password.
* Check the box with the acknowledgement of losing the password.

Press the _**Continue**_ button. A _.bak_ file will be automatically downloaded. This file contains the account details to restore your Vodconi account if needed.

{% hint style="success" %}
Your account is now protected, store this file in a safe place.
{% endhint %}

### Language

This option allows you to select the preferred language. At present 3 languages are available:

* English
* Català
* Spanish

### Help and feedback

This option redirects to the Vocdoni documentation.

### Logout

This option allows you to log out of your account.

{% hint style="warning" %}
To access your account after a logout again you need your _.bak_ backup file.
