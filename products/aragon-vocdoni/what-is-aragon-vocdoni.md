# What is Aragon Vocdoni

**Vocdoni** is a project inside of the Aragon ecosystem, aimed at developing secure **digital voting solutions** using decentralized technologies.

The main product is the **voting platform**, which allows participation from conventional Organizations with guarantees of security and privacy.

The **voting protocol** which powers the platform is designed to be **universally verifiable, secure, and resistant** to attack and censorship through the use of blockchain technology, together with decentralized technologies and cryptographic mechanisms, such as [zero-knowledge proofs.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge\_proof)

On Oct 2022, the voting process was improved with a new important feature: **Anonymous Voting**. Anonymous voting is a voting system that allows users to vote with the cryptographic assurance that nobody can correlate their identity with the contents of their ballot. (You can read more about Anonymous Voting and its implementation [here](https://blog.aragon.org/introducing-vocdoni-anonymous-voting/)).
