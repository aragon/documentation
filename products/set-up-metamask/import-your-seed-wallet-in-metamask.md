{% hint style="info" %}
In this section, we'll go through how to import the seed wallet into the Metamask wallet.
{% endhint %}

### Log in to your Metamask wallet

The first step is to open up the Metamask browser extension and to log in. If you're using Chrome you should be able to open Metamask by clicking on the fox icon located to the right of your address bar _(see the image below)_.

If you can't see it, [_click here_](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/metamask). This will open up an interface to your Ethereum wallet.

You should see a black drop down menu appear _(see image below)_.

You'll be taken to a _Welcome Back_ page.

### Importing the 12 words phrase will allow you to use Metamask with your wallet.

Click on _Import using account seed phrase_. Metamask should now open up in a new tab with a heading _**Restore your account with Seed Phrase**_. Import the unique phrase you were given when setting up your account.

Note that your mnemonic phrase won't be the same as mine. So make sure you copy yours from your terminal, and not from this blog.
{% endhint %}

### Create a new password

Once you copied the 12 word seed phrase, paste it into the wallet seed text box, and create a new password (see image below).

You've now connected Metamask to an Ethereum account.
