## How does it work?

The [Aragon client](https://github.com/aragon/aragon) is a **full dapp** that can **create and manage decentralized organizations** by running Aragon apps inside it.

The client provides Aragon app developers with the following capabilities:

* **Sandboxing**: The client is running code from third-party developers and so in order to mitigate risk (such as cross-site scripting and phishing attempts by manipulating the DOM) we sandbox apps.
* **App listing**: It traverses the organization to find all the relevant apps for it.
* **Transaction pathing**: It checks with the [ACL ](permissions.md)to see if the user can perform an action (e.g. withdrawing funds) and if not, it gives the user alternative paths to perform it (e.g. maybe by opening a vote)
* **Human readable transactions**: It uses [Radspec](human-readable-transactions.md) and describes the user action in a human-readable way
* **Notifications**: Aragon apps can send notifications to the user when something relevant happens

It looks like this:&#x20;
