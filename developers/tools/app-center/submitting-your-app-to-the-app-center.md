# Submitting Your App to the App Center

For the time being, we ask that you submit an [issue to the `aragon/aragon` repo](https://github.com/aragon/aragon/issues/new/choose) as a `Feature request` with the following:

* Name of your application
* Link to its development repo
* Link to an organization with the application installed
* Current development status
* Short summary explaining what the application does

Please double check that your app includes the relevant assets and that they are in the correct formats ([see guide](preparing-assets.md)).

{% hint style="info" %}
We will update this page accordingly as we build more community-governed infrastructure for curating apps in the future.
{% endhint %}
