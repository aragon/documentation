# Setting up a Metamask Wallet

{% hint style="info" %}
In this section, you will learn how to set up a Metamask wallet and how to configure it for use with the [Quick Start section](../../../the-basics/getting-started.md).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
#### We recommend using [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) as your Web3 wallet.&#x20;

Metamask is a browser plugin that lets you make Ethereum (and other blockchains) transactions through regular websites.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
This guide focuses on a **Chrome extension**. However, the process is similar for all browsers.
{% endhint %}

## Getting started <a href="#getting-started" id="getting-started"></a>

Visit the [Metamask homepage](https://metamask.io/) and download the browser extension. Once it is downloaded, you should be automatically directed to a welcome page:&#x20;

Setup your Metamask account following the instructions.

Once your Metamask setup is complete, you should be redirected to your newly created Ethereum wallet:

![Metamask account](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/mm account.png>)

{% hint style="success" %}
If you have made it this far, congratulations ðŸŽ‰.
{% endhint %}

## Account address <a href="#account-address" id="account-address"></a>

If you click on the **"three dots"** button below your account name -â€Šin our case _Account 1_â€Š-â€Ša popup will appear with your account address. It should look similar to the example below:

> **0x931D387731bBbC988B312206c74F77D004D6B84b**

{% hint style="success" %}
This is your public address (or public key). You can share this with other people to receive ETH or other tokens.
{% endhint %}

## Selected networks <a href="#selected-networks" id="selected-networks"></a>

In the top right you should see a dropdown menu with _**Main Ethereum Network**_ selected. With this option, you are able to interact directly with the main Ethereum blockchain.

If you click on it, a selection of other networks will be shown:&#x20;

## Why should you select other networks?&#x20;

Before launching a project (or dapp) on the main Ethereum network, it is good practice to deploy a version to an Ethereum test network (like Rinkeby) or on other main networks (like Polygon or Harmony) with low-cost fees to save on costs for transaction fees.

### The benefits of using a test net

The main reason for using a test net ETH is that it can be obtained without having to pay real money. This gives developers and the community a chance to iron out any problems before real money is involved.

#### There are four test nets:&#x20;

* Ropsten
* Kovan
* Rinkeby
* Goerli

{% hint style="warning" %}
**At this stage don't worry about the differences between these networks.** All you need to know is that they simulate Ethereum and can be used without having to pay real money.
{% endhint %}

### Using private networks

Finally, you can also interact with private Ethereum networks by selecting **Localhost 8545**. Private in this case doesn't mean more secure. It just means that the nodes are not connected to the main or test network nodes. **Perfect for rapid experimentation and testing.**

{% hint style="warning" %}
Remember that if you want to use different networks, you need to set up your wallet and load your wallet with enough funds for paying the transaction fees.&#x20;
