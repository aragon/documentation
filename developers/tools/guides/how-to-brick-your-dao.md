**Don't try this at home!** This guide is meant to make you aware of some of the mistakes you can make which will **brick** ðŸ§± (ruin) your DAO.

## Top ways to Brick ðŸ§± your DAO:

1. Set the minimum accepted Quorum Percentage of Votes in your DAO to 100%, and then lose access to the only Wallet Account which can vote :scream:.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Lesson**

Reconsider whether a high 100% Quorum is necessary, and make sure you always have a backup of your Wallet Account secret recovery phrase.
{% endhint %}

2\. Go to the Aragon Forum for help and copy/ paste the private keys of the Web3 Wallet controlling your DAO. Someone found the private keys, took control of your wallet and is now in control of your DAO :scream:.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Lesson**

Never ever share 'secrets' like your private keys, secret recovery phrase, or something else secret on a public forum, Discord server, or not even in a direct message (DM), there are a lot of scammers out there looking for this info.
{% endhint %}

3\. Mint new DAO tokens to the address of the DAO, instead of to a DAO member, which makes the 'DAO address' the largest token holder. DAO addresses can not vote, and since it is the largest DAO token holder not a single vote can be enacted anymore :scream:.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**Lesson**

Only mint DAO tokens to DAO members wallet addresses, and never send them to a smart contract such as the address of your DAO.
{% endhint %}

4\. You have a bad actor in your DAO and want to get rid of him by removing/ burning all of his DAO tokens. Accidentally you remove/ burn all of your own DAO tokens, and the Vote to do so has already been approved by your DAO members! Now you lost control over your DAO :scream:.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**Lesson**

It's easy to make fatal mistakes, always double-check the details when making transactions in your DAO.
