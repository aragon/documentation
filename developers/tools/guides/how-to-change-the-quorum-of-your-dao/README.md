# How to change the Quorum of your DAO

{% hint style="info" %}
Did you setup a DAO on Aragon Client, only to later realize that you want to change the **minimum Quorum** (turnout) for votes in your DAO? Then this guide is for you!

But also if you want to change the default **minimum Quorum Percentage**, or something else, you can use the same principles as in this guide.

As they say: 'there is more than one road leading to Rome'! In this case we will show you the two easiest options to do it:

1. [Using the inbuilt (hidden) **Console** in Aragon Client](change-quorum-using-aragon-console.md)
2. [Using **EVM Crispr**, a tool to edit the 'DNA' of DAOs](change-quorum-using-evmcrispr.md)
