**WARNING**

Aragon Govern is **beta software** which is **NOT MAINTAINED** anymore.&#x20;

It's a really cool product though with innovative and nifty smart contracts around **Optimistic Governance**. So although you might run into an **error** üê≤ here and there, the documentation is definitely worth the read and the play!

And welcome to connect with us through [Discord](https://discord.gg/thyHMDt) or our technical [forum](https://support.aragon.org/c/dev-support/20)!

Welcome to Aragon Govern's documentation!

Aragon Govern is software for creating and governing organizations such as DeFi projects, open source projects, gaming guilds, cooperatives, nonprofits, clubs, companies, and any other type of organization you can imagine. It's Aragon's implementation of ERC-3000, the standard for binding off-chain voting.

Along with off-chain voting solutions like [Snapshot](https://snapshot.page/) it allows you to _govern_ all parts of your project, even if not completely decentralized, in an easy manner, also allowing for flexibility and extensions when needed.
