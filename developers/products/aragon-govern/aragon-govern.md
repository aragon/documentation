## Aragon Govern

Govern is Aragon's new Smart Contract system to manage unstoppable organizations on the blockchain in an efficient and decentralized manner. It's architectured using ERC3000, the up and coming governance standard.

**üö® Security Review Status: pre-audit**

The code in [this repository](https://github.com/aragon/govern) has **not** been audited.

**üëã Get started contributing with a** [**good first issue**](https://github.com/aragon/govern/labels/good%20first%20issue%20%F0%9F%8C%9E)

Before explaining how you can contribute, It's worth mentioning that we use `develop` branch as the default one. This makes it easier for us to have all the latest, development changes without affecting the current production version. Note: we don't use `release` branches to make the development process a little bit easier! Other notes:

* Pushing to `develop` branch via PR deploys changes to testing environments (currently only Rinkeby testnet).
* Pushing to `master` branch via PR from `develop` deploys changes to production servers (Ethereum mainnet).
* Pushing to `master|develop` directly will be restricted to make sure the PR's are reviewed.
* Creating PRs end up in relation to `develop` by default.

Don't be shy to contribute even the smallest tweak! Everyone will be nice and helpful to beginners to help you get started!

## Structure

This repo uses Lerna and yarn workspaces to bootstrap itself, and is divided into multiple independent sub-packages:

* [`erc3k`](packages/erc-3k.md): Aragon's reference implementation of [ERC3000](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3000), the up and coming governance standard.
* [`Govern.js`](packages/govern.js.md): Govern's official JS wrapper for creating seamless DAO experiences.
* [`Govern Console`](packages/govern-console.md): No-frills, forkable, extensible power user / developer UI tool for interacting with and visualizing low level information about Govern DAOs. Can be found on Github [here](https://github.com/aragon/console).
* [`Govern Contract Utils`](https://github.com/aragon/govern): Set of all libraries and utilities used by the core Govern contracts.
* [`Govern Core`](packages/types.md): The core set of Aragon Govern contracts.
* [`Govern Create`](packages/govern-create.md): Set of templates used to create new Govern instances.
* [`Govern Discord`](https://github.com/aragon/govern/tree/develop/packages/govern-discord): Govern-native Discord bot for DAOs.
* [`Govern Server`](https://github.com/aragon/govern/tree/develop/packages/govern-server): Server powering Govern.js and the Govern API to enable Web2-like experiences for DAOs.
* [`Govern Subgraph`](https://github.com/aragon/govern/tree/develop/packages/govern-subgraph): Govern's official Subgraph, which tracks DAOs registered on the A1-deployed ERC3000Registry.
