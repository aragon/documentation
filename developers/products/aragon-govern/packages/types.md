# Types

We use TypeChain to add static typing to smart contracts. [Learn more](https://github.com/ethereum-ts/TypeChain#getting-started-).

**WARNING**

Aragon Govern is **beta software** which is **NOT MAINTAINED** anymore. It's a really cool product though with innovative and nifty smart contracts. So although you might run into an **error** üê≤ here and there, the documentation is definitely worth the read and the play!

And welcome to connect with us through [Discord](https://discord.gg/thyHMDt) or our technical [forum](https://support.aragon.org/c/dev-support/20)!
