# Govern Server

{% hint style="danger" %}
**WARNING**

Aragon Govern is **beta software** which is **NOT MAINTAINED** anymore. It's a really cool product though with innovative and nifty smart contracts. So although you might run into an **error** üê≤ here and there, the documentation is definitely worth the read and the play!

And welcome to connect with us through [Discord](https://discord.gg/thyHMDt) or our technical [forum](https://support.aragon.org/c/dev-support/20)!

## How to query data

Govern Server is exposing a GraphQL API that lets you fetch data related to your Govern DAOs. Have a look at the [Govern Server API documentation](../aragon-govern-1/developers/graphql-api.md) for the list of types and queries you can use.

## Directory structure

```
# The core server library, which will be in a separate package later.
# We should keep in mind that this part will eventually run in the
# browser, enabling the fully decentralized mode of Aragon Govern.
/src/core

# API endpoints are prefixed by ‚Äúapi-‚Äù. We‚Äôll only have a GraphQL API at first,
# and a REST API will be added later. Each API server exposes a single start()
# function with its configuration as a parameter.
/src/api-graphql
```

## Docker container

Build a docker container and expose server on http://localhost:3000:

```
docker build . -t govern-server
docker run -it --rm -d -p 3000:3000 --name govern-server govern-server
```

Remove the container:

```
docker stop govern-server
```

## CI/CD

Github Actions workflow `server-ci-cd.yml` builds and deploys a server container when creating `v*` tags in the `master` branch.

Deployments can be triggered using lerna:

```
yarn lerna version [ major | minor | patch ]
```
