# Which was the wallet address used to create the Aragon Govern DAO?

The wallet address that has created the Aragon Govern can be read directly on the blockchain using the _DAO Govern Executor Address_ (you can find it in the _Settings_ of your Aragon Govern DAO):

* Go into your Govern DAO: _Settings - DAO Govern Executor Address - copy the address._&#x20;

If your DAO is on Rinkeby go [here](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/) and paste the copied address in the search bar.

If you DAO is on Ethereum go [here](https://etherscan.io/) and paste the copied address in the search bar.&#x20;

Go to the _transactions_ section list on the Etherscan page. Here you go to the first and oldest transaction, click on the _txn hash_. A new page (named _Transaction Details_) will be opened - the _from_ address is the address of your wallet address.
