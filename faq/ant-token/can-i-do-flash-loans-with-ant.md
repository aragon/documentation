# Can I do flash loans with ANT?

Yes. **Uniswap flash swaps** allow you to withdraw as much ANT as you want at no upfront cost and do anything you want with them (execute arbitrary code), provided that by the end of the transaction execution, you either:

* pay for all the ANT withdrawn
* pay for a percentage of the ANT tokens and return the rest
* return all ANT withdrawn
