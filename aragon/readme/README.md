# Aragon Values, Finances, and Legal

{% hint style="warning" %}
Learn about Aragon: our values, our finances, as well as technical and legal infrastructure.
{% endhint %}

## Manifesto

Aragon is governed by [our manifesto ](https://aragon.org/manifesto)- a living document developed by the community and is evolving with time.

## Mission

Aragon is a community-driven project with a mission to **empower freedom** by creating tools for **decentralized governance** to thrive.

These tools help people freely organize **across borders** and **without intermediaries.** Instead of bureaucracy, subjectivity, and trust, the use of smart contracts has opened the door to **experiment with decentralized governance (at the speed of software)**.

Organizations that can be spun up instantly, can't be shut down by governments, are resistant to internet censorship, and allow small groups of people to collaborate effectively.

Aragon takes care of the most important pieces of infrastructure to deliver censorship-resistant, decentralized and upgradeable apps.

## Vision

Aragon **provides the lego pieces** to allow people (like you) to build the **next generation of human organizations**.

## Our users

If you're new to this ecosystem, don't worry if some (or all) of the above sounded a bit abstract. You can think of Aragon as **providing the lego pieces** to allow people (like you) to build the **next generation of human organizations**.
