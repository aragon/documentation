# üèó Setting up a Gnosis Safe MultiSig Wallet

{% hint style="warning" %}
Here we are going to use [**Gnosis Safe MultiSig**](https://gnosis-safe.io), however, you could follow a similar approach for any other MultiSig wallet that supports contract interaction.
{% endhint %}

###

## Setting up the necessary permissions

{% hint style="info" %}
Aragon Client DAOs have access to a control system, where each action is protected by a set of permission records. Only someone with specific permissions can act.

**That is why we need to assign the MultiSig wallet to a range of permissions in the DAO that correspond with the desired actions.**

You can read more about permission settings [here](aragon-client/explore-template-dao/system-setting/permissions-setting.md).
{% endhint %}



In this example an Aragon Client DAO has a balance of ETH tokens stored in its Vault and you want to initiate a payment to compensate a DAO Contributor for her work. We will show how to **initiate a withdrawal of some of the ETH to the Contributor.**



Start by opening your Aragon Client DAO, you should see a similar dashboard as in the image below. Click in the left hand menu on 'Permissions':

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/a1_Sig.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

We want to add new permissions for your MultiSig, so click in this screen on 'New permission':

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/a2_sig.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You should see the following side-window appear. Click on 'Select an app':

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/a3_sig.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

For this example we want to initiate a withdrawal of ETH by the MultiSig. This is usually done from the Finance app of the DAO, so select 'Finance' here and then click on 'Select an entity':

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/a4_sig.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Since we need to add the address of your MultiSig, click here on 'Custom address...':

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/a5_sig.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Now go to your Gnosis Safe, copy its address and paste the address of your MultiSig in the 'GRANT PERMISSION TO' box. Then click on 'Select an action':

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/a6_sig.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="danger" %}
Do not forget to remove the letters from the front of the Gnosis Safe address,**`eth:`**or**`gor:`**or different depending on the network you use! Otherwise it won't work..

The address should start with: **`0x`**
{% endhint %}



In this case we want to initiate a new payment, so click on 'Create new payments':

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/a7_sig.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Now you filled the required boxes, click on 'Add permission':

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/a8_sig.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Here the app warns that the permission can not be directly changed, but that a vote will be created to change the permission. Click on 'Create transaction':

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/a9_sig.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

A transaction should pop-up in your Web3 Wallet, 'Confirm' the transaction:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/a10_sig.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Once the transaction has processed, head over to the 'Voting' app of your DAO. You should see that an open vote has been generated. Click on the vote:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/a11_sig.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Now confirm the vote by clicking 'Yes':

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/a12_sig.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Click here on 'Create transaction' and confirm the transaction that should pop-up in your Web3 Wallet:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/a13_sig.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In our example it confirmed that the vote has passed:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/a14_sig.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="danger" %}
More DAO members might need to approve the vote for the vote to pass. This depends on the **SUPPORT** and **MINIMUM APPROVAL** settings of your DAO
{% endhint %}

Now head over to the 'Permissions' app to check whether the permission for your MultiSig has been added. In our case click on the **Finance** app, and then unfold the 'Create new payments' permission. We now see that the MultiSig address has appeared!

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/a15_sig.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## Initiate payment at the MultiSig

Now that's done we can initiate a payment at the MultiSig!



Head back to the (in this case) Gnosis Safe and press on 'New Transaction'. In the pop-up window which appears, press 'Contract Interaction':

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/a16_sig.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

We now need the 'Contract address' of the app we want to interact with, which is the Finance app in this case:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/a17_sig.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

So head back to your Aragon Client DAO, open the **Organization** app, click on the address under (in this case) 'FINANCE', and copy the address:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/a18_sig.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Paste the address in the 'Contract address' field back in the Gnosis Safe:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/a19_sig.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="danger" %}
If the 'ABI' field automatically populates, **REMOVE** all the contents in the field, since we will need a different ABI
{% endhint %}

Now we need to get the ABI of the base contract of the app we interact with, which is the **Finance** app in this case. Click on 'Finance App' in the box below:

{% hint style="info" %}
You can find Etherscan links to the smart contracts of the most used apps below:

* [Tokens App](https://etherscan.io/address/0xde3A93028F2283cc28756B3674BD657eaFB992f4#code)
* [Finance App](https://etherscan.io/address/0x836835289A2E81B66AE5d95b7c8dBC0480dCf9da#code)
* [Voting App](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb935C3D80229d5D92f3761b17Cd81dC2610e3a45#code)
{% endhint %}



On the Etherscan page, scroll down until you see the 'Contract ABI' box. Click on the Copy symbol, to copy the ABI of the smart contract:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/a20_sig.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Paste the ABI in the 'ABI' field in the Gnosis Safe, and click on 'Method':

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/a21_sig (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Search here for 'newImmediatePayment', since we want to do an immediate payment in this example, and select it:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/a22_sig.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Now find the 'token address' of the token you want to send. In this case we are sending ETH. The token address of ETH is: `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`

Add the 'receiver address' of in this example the Contributor.

Then add the 'amount'. In this case we will send the DAO Contributor an amount of 0.1 ETH.

{% hint style="danger" %}
For the 'amount' field, add 18 decimals to the original value. For example, if you want to invoke the**`newImmediatePayment`**method to transfer 10.5 tokens, you will have to input 10.5 \* 10 ^ 18 = **`10500000000000000000`** into the amount field.
{% endhint %}

In our example the amount is 0.1 \* 10 ^ 18 = `100000000000000000`

Then you can add a 'reference string' as a payment reference, and click on 'Review':

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/a23_sig.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Scroll down and test the transaction by clicking on 'Simulate'. If all is well it should display 'Success'. If so, click on 'Submit':

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/a24_sig.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="danger" %}
If the **simulation has failed** and you get warnings (like a gas estimation error) there has likely been a mistake either in permissions, method parameters, or ABI and contract address. Please go through the setup again
{% endhint %}

A transaction should pop-up in your Web3 Wallet. 'Confirm' the transaction and wait for it to be processed. If all good, it executed:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/a25_sig.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Head back for the last time to your Aragon Client DAO :fingers\_crossed:, and open the **Finance** app. In our example we see that a 'Contributor compensation' of 0.1 ETH is displaying in the 'Transfers' overview:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/a26_sig.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

We did it! :partying\_face: Well done! :medal:
